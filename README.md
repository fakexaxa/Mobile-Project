## Build tools & versions used
Android Studio, compileSdk 33
I also used Postman to get a full view of the JSON that I am getting, very helpful tool.

## Steps to run the app
On android studio, click File, Open, then open the location of the project.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I focus on what Architecture I should use on the project, on the project structure I use MVVM that uses dagger/hilt.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
The reason for that is using dependency injection such as dagger/hilt, it will make the app more easy to unit test.

## How long did you spend on this project?
6-7 hours.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
if I have more time I would like to modernize this project using JetPack compose. As of now I tried to build this project using the knowledge that I am confident with so I build the UI part using xml files.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I tried to make it the best as I know of but if I have more time I would add more unit test on GetEmployeeUseCaseImpl because there is also logic that is happening there.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
Since I build the project from a scratch I spent most of my time getting the correct dependencies.
Also had issue on android studio where when you try to create a blank project it will not build because you will have to add gradlePluginPortal() on the settings.gradle that I spent a lot of time researching.
I will also put all the dimens and strings to their proper locations. I added some on the strings.xml but not all.
Please give me some feedback! thanks!
